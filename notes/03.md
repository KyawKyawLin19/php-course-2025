# What is Data Abstraction in PHP?
- Data Abstraction in PHP is about hiding the internal details of a class and exposing only the operations the user needs.
- Implementation details (like arrays, counters) are hidden using private or protected members.
- Users interact with the class only through public methods.
- This allows creation of custom data types like Stack, LinkedList, Queue.

---
#### Example 1: Stack using PHP Class
```
<?php
class Stack {
    // Hidden internal details (implementation)
    private array $items = [];
    private int $maxSize = 5;

    // Public method to add item (essential feature)
    public function push(int $value): void {
        if (count($this->items) >= $this->maxSize) {
            echo "Stack Overflow!\n";
        } else {
            $this->items[] = $value;
        }
    }

    // Public method to remove item (essential feature)
    public function pop(): ?int {
        if (empty($this->items)) {
            echo "Stack Underflow!\n";
            return null;
        }
        return array_pop($this->items);
    }

    // Public method to see top item
    public function top(): ?int {
        return empty($this->items) ? null : end($this->items);
    }
}

// Usage
$stack = new Stack();
$stack->push(10);
$stack->push(20);
echo "Top element: " . $stack->top() . "\n"; // 20
echo "Popped element: " . $stack->pop() . "\n"; // 20
?>
```

#####    Explanation

| Concept          | PHP Example                                    |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Hidden data      | `$items` array and `$maxSize` are `private`. |
| Visible operations | `push()`, `pop()`, `top()` are `public`.    |
| User perspective | User doesn’t see the array, only uses methods. |
| Custom data type | `Stack` behaves like a new data type created by you. |
---
#### Example 2: Using Abstract Class
```
<?php
abstract class DataStructure {
    abstract public function add($value);
    abstract public function remove();
}

class Stack extends DataStructure {
    private array $items = [];

    public function add($value) {
        $this->items[] = $value;
    }

    public function remove() {
        return array_pop($this->items);
    }
}

// Usage
$s = new Stack();
$s->add(100);
$s->add(200);

echo "Removed: " . $s->remove() . "\n"; // 200
?>
```
##### Explanation

| Concept                        | PHP Example                                      |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| DataStructure abstraction       | `DataStructure` is abstract → defines interface for all structures. |
| Stack implementation            | `Stack` implements the methods.               |
| User perspective / abstraction  | Users don’t see internal array → abstraction maintained. |

## Destructive vs Non-Destructive Modification in PHP

In PHP, **destructive modification** changes the original data directly, while **non-destructive modification** keeps the original data unchanged and returns a new value.

### 1. Arrays

```php
// Destructive example
$numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
array_pop($numbers);       // removes last element from original array
print_r($numbers);         // [1, 2, 3]

// Non-destructive example
$numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
$newNumbers = array_slice($numbers, 0, 3); // take first 3 elements without changing original
print_r($numbers);        // [1, 2, 3, 4] -> original unchanged
print_r($newNumbers);     // [1, 2, 3]
```

### 2. Strings

```php
// Destructive example
$text = "hello";
$text = str_replace("h", "H", $text); // changes original string
echo $text; // Hello

// Non-destructive example
$text = "hello";
$newText = strtoupper($text); // creates new uppercase string
echo $text;    // hello -> original unchanged
echo $newText; // HELLO
```

### 3. Objects
```php
class Person { 
    public $name; 
}

// Destructive example
$p = new Person();
$p->name = "Alice";
$p->name = "Bob"; // modifies original object
echo $p->name;    // Bob

// Non-destructive example
$p1 = new Person();
$p1->name = "Alice";
$p2 = clone $p1;  // create new object
$p2->name = "Bob";
echo $p1->name;   // Alice -> original unchanged
echo $p2->name;   // Bob -> new object modified
```
### Summary:
- Destructive → modifies original data (array_pop, assignment, object property change)
- Non-destructive → keeps original data intact (array_slice, strtoupper, clone)
- Existing ADT(Abstract Data Type) => destructive modification
- In OOP, using inheritance, we can extend functionality or modify behavior without changing the original code.

## Abstraction Vs OOP
✅ **Summary:**
| Concept          | Focus                                      | Example                                     |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Data Abstraction | Hide details, show only essential features | Abstract classes, interfaces               |
| OOP             | Model real-world objects & behaviors       | Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
---
### <u>Object Based Language</u>
- If a language can create objects but does not include the three main features (Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism), it is called an **object-based language**.

How Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Models the Real World Through Three Key Concepts
- Classification (by means of class)
- Taxonomy (by means of inheritance)
- Specialization (by means of polymorphism)
### 1. Classification (by means of class)
What it means: Grouping similar objects together based on common characteristics
Real world example: 
```
All cars have wheels, engines, doors → We create a "Car" class
In programming: We define classes that represent categories of objects with shared properties and behaviors
```
### 2. Taxonomy (by means of inheritance)
What it means: Creating hierarchical relationships between classes, like a family tree
Real world example:
```
Vehicle (parent) → Car, Truck, Motorcycle (children)
Animal → Mammal → Dog, Cat
```
In programming: Child classes inherit properties from parent classes but can have their own unique features
### 3. Specialization (by means of polymorphism)
What it means: Same action can behave differently depending on the object
Real world example:
```
"Make sound" → Dog barks, Cat meows, Bird chirps
"Start" → Car engine starts, Computer boots up
```
In programming: Same method name can do different things for different classes

Why This Matters
OOP mirrors how we naturally think about and organize the real world. 
- Group similar things (classification)
- Organize them in hierarchies (taxonomy)
- Recognize that similar actions work differently for different things (specialization)

This makes programming more intuitive and easier to understand because it follows natural human thinking patterns.

## Pure and Impure OO Languages

### Pure Object-Oriented Languages
- **Smalltalk**  
- **Ruby** (almost pure)  
- **Eiffel**  

**Characteristics:**  
- ✅ Everything is an object  
- ✅ All operations are done via objects  
- ✅ Fully supports **Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism**

---

### Impure (Hybrid) Object-Oriented Languages
- **C++**  
- **Java**  
- **Python**  
- **PHP**  

**Characteristics:**  
- ✅ Objects and classes are supported  
- ✅ Can also write procedural or non-object-oriented code  
- ✅ OO features (**Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism**) are optional

### Summary Table

| Type       | Everything is Object? | OO Features Mandatory? | Examples                  |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Pure OO    | Yes                 | Yes                  | Smalltalk, Ruby, Eiffel  |
| Impure OO  | No                  | No                   | C++, Java, Python, PHP   |
