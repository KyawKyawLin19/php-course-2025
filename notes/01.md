# Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics of Programming Languages
- Syntax = Grammar → Is the sentence/code written correctly?
- Semantics = Meaning → What does it literally mean/do?
- Pragmatics = Use in context → Why do we say/write it this way here?
```
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello")
```
- Syntax: Correct use of for, in, range(), : and indentation.
- Semantics: Prints "Hello" five times.
- Pragmatics: Why use a loop at all? Because in real life, repeating print("Hello") five times manually would be inefficient. A loop is the better choice in context.

## Syntax
Syntax is the set of rules that define how code must be written (the grammar of a programming language).

**Example (Python for loop):**
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

👉 If you forget the `:` or indentation, it causes a **Syntax Error**.

---

## Semantics
Semantics is the meaning of the code once it is written correctly. It explains how the program behaves.

**Example:**
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

**Semantics:**
- `range(5)` → `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
- Variable `i` takes each value
- Prints each number

**Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

👉 Syntax may be correct but semantics wrong (e.g., `range("five")`) → runtime error.

## Pragmatics
Pragmatics is how code is used in real-world situations. It’s about *why* and *when* we choose one form over another.

**Example:**
```python
# Pragmatic use: repeat an action 5 times
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello World")
```

- Here, the loop is used for repetition.
- In Python, we usually loop over collections.
- In C, index-based `for` loops are more common.


## PHP is a multi-paradigm language:
- It supports procedural programming.
- It supports OOP.
- It even supports functional features.
