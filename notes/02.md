# PHP Programming Paradigms

PHP is a **multi-paradigm programming language**.  
It supports **procedural**, **object-oriented**, and even some **functional** programming styles.

---

## 1. Procedural PHP (Early Style)
- PHP originally started as a procedural language (like C).
- Code is organized into functions and executed step by step.

**Example:**
```php
<?php
function add($a, $b) {
    return $a + $b;
}

echo add(2, 3); // 5
?>
```

---

## 2. Object-Oriented PHP (Modern Style)
- From PHP 5 onwards, OOP features were added: classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces, traits.
- OOP is widely used in frameworks like Laravel, Symfony.

**Example:**
```php
<?php
class Calculator {
    public function add($a, $b) {
        return $a + $b;
    }
}

$calc = new Calculator();
echo $calc->add(2, 3); // 5
?>
```

## 3. Functional Style in PHP
- Modern PHP (7 & 8) supports functional programming features like anonymous functions, closures, and arrow functions.

**Example:**
```php
<?php
$numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using array_map with a closure
$squares = array_map(function($n) {
    return $n * $n;
}, $numbers);

print_r($squares); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
?>
```

## ✅ Summary
- **Procedural PHP** → Functions, step-by-step logic (common in older code).  
- **OOP PHP** → Classes, objects, modern frameworks (most common today).  
- **Functional PHP** → Closures, array functions, arrow functions (increasingly used).  

👉 **PHP is not just procedural anymore, it is multi-paradigm.**
